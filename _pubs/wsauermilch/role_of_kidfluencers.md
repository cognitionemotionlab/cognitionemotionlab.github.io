Kidfluencers comprise a relatively new form of advertising to which young adolescents are exposed. Therefore, this study explored the relation between exposure to kidfluencers and the purchase of products found in kidfluencer content among a sample of 300 U.S. young adolescents. Results of a survey revealed that tweens’ exposure to kidfluencers is associated with their purchase of kidfluencer-related products through a desire to emulate kidfluencers, and that materialism moderates this relationship. Findings suggest that kidfluencers may propagate a lifestyle to which tweens aspire that may manifest itself in changes to consumer behavior.
