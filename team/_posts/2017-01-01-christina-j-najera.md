Christina Jimenez Najera is a doctoral candidate in the College of Media and Communication at TTU and a member of the Cognition and Emotion Lab. She brings 12+ years of a mix of law, television, and marketing experience into her research and teaching. Her overall research interests are in the cognitive and emotional processing of messages related to two distinct areas: risky driving behavior and body image. She investigates the role of motivated processing in distracted driving behaviors and choices, and the development of body image issues among college aged men and women.

Her work is driven by theories drawn from communication science, cognitive neuroscience, public health, and social psychology. Further, her work is methodologically diverse as she uses interviews, content analyses, surveys, and experimental designs to answer her research questions. In addition, she is trained in the construction, execution, and analysis of psychophysiological experiments.

Christina has a unique, executable line of research. Currently, she is working on her dissertation which explores possible mechanisms of defensive processing that may drive counter-arguing of risk-related public service information, and the role of multi-tasking in primary and secondary tasks in distracted driving.

She received her B.A. in Entertainment and Tourism in 2013 and her M.A. in Professional Communication in 2016 from California State University, Fullerton. She is currently finishing her PhD in Media and Communication.
