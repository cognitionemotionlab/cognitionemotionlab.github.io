I am a member and co-Lab Manager at the [Cognition & Emotion Lab](http://www.ttucel.com/). As a Master's student I am studying the effects of task demand on mood management, and am interested in studying the relationship between between educational rehabilitation medium and perception of chronic pain.

I received my bachelor's degree in Electronic Media & Communication from Texas Tech University. After graduating, I became a news producer for KWES-TV before returning to Texas Tech University where I work as the IT Support Specialist II for the College of Media & Communication while pursing my graduate education.
