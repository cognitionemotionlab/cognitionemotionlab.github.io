Willow Sauermilch is a doctoral candidate and graduate researcher in the College of Media and Communication and co-lab manager of the Cognition and Emotion Lab. She brings a unique, interdisciplinary perspective to her research, integrating her background in mass communication with her expertise and experience in communication sciences and disorders. 

Willow’s primarily line of research focuses on exploring media processing and effects related to parent-child communication during technology use, including implications associated with language development and interventions for individuals with communication impairments. Her secondary line of research focuses on the portrayal of individuals with disabilities in mass media programming and how such messages shape public perception and the adoption of health-related information.
