I am of the [Cognition & Emotion Lab](http://www.ttucel.com/). I began working in politics since I was 8 years old, and politics quickly became my passion. I have spent time on Capitol Hill and have been involved with multiple political organizations. My focus at this time is combining political communication, source credibility and psychological reactance theory to work to better understand the ever-growing political division in the United States. My cognate is statistics, and I plan to be completed with my degree by June 2021.

In addition to being a Ph.D. candidate, I work full time as the Donor Relations Manager at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, the largest health sciences center in the state of Texas. I oversee donor relations stewardship and efforts for university leadership, all campuses and institutes. 

I received my Bachelor of Science degree in Political Science and Communication Studies with an emphasis in Corporate Communication from West Texas A&M University in Canyon, Texas in 2015. I received my Master of Arts in Public Relations from Texas Texas University in 2016.
