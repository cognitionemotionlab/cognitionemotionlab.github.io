I am a first year MA student originally from Nebraska. In December 2016, I graduated from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln with degrees in Broadcasting and Advertising/Public Relations. After graduation I began taking psychology classes for fun, and I haven't stopped. My research interests are in Media Psychology as well as Health Communication.
